 # Progress
 
 ## 1st experiment: sequential implementation of GA
 
 * Working implementation by Valentin
 * Done, needs to be benchmarked
 * Maybe some optimization and cleaning can be done
 
 ## 2nd experiment: naive parallel implementation with MPI
 
 ## 3rd experiment: island based implementation
 
 ## 4th experiment: asynchronous migration
 
 ## 5th experiment: RDMA migration
